          As the name suggests, various data structures and algorithms introduced.
          That includes dynamic programming, greedy approaches. The data structures
          included various trees, heaps and other structures.
          The course closely followed the CLRS book. As a part of associated lab
          a big integer library for C++ was developed, using which a basic form of
          RSA system was implemented. Also, various data-structures were implemented
          in C++ as part of the lab.

        <div class="course-detail">
          Various architectures were introduced. In this course, many things as to
          how computers actually work became clear. Memory and storage systems were
          explained. In the associated lab, we wrote code in assembly language. The 
          assignments included implementding recursive functions in assembly language, 
          stack manipulation and input output management to name a few.
          NASM was used for the assignments.

          Various grammars were introduced. From finite state automata to multitape turing
          machines, various models of computations were covered. Undecidibility and intractibility were
          discussed.

        <div class="course-detail">
          Basics of language translators like scanning, parsing, 3 address code generation
          and machine code generation was covered. Also some basic optimizations were touched
          upon.
          As part of associated lab assignments, we implemented a program to convert programs
          written in a subset of pascal into 3 address code. YACC and Lex were used for the same.
          Also, we wrote program to traslate the 3 address code thus generated into a C code, in
          which activation records are explicitly taken care of.

          For each of the paradign among imperative, object oriented, functional and logic one language each 
          (C, C++, Common Lisp and Prolog) was used to demostrate the programming style, programming
          philosophy, strengths and weaknesses of that particular paradigm.

          Modelling a process, threads and synchronization problems, memory management,
          device management, input output management and system security were among the 
          topic covered in the course.
          The lab assignments involved working on the linux kernel. Two of the notable assignments
          involved writing a basic shell program and writing a new scheduling policy based on
          user-group weights for the linux kernel.

          Various techinques for classfication and clustering were discussed.
          The problem of "Whether it is possible to write a classifier which
          classifies the problems into classes depending on which classifier
          solves it the best." was dicsussed.
          Assignments included writing a basic bayesian spam filter and analysing
          performance of various classfiers on some given datasets using weka.
